### Technology Stack

- **Backend**: FastAPI with async/await, SQLAlchemy 2.0, PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: Bootstrap 5, Vanilla JavaScript, Font Awesome icons
- **APIs**: Google Maps Platform (Places, Geocoding), Salesforce REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with async support
- **Authentication**: Simple password-only access with session tokens

## üìã Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- PostgreSQL 13+ (or use Railway/Supabase)
- Google Cloud Platform account (for Maps API)
- Git

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/looklike-nearby.git
cd looklike-nearby

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

```bash
# Copy environment template
cp env.example .env

# Edit .env with your configuration
nano .env
```

Required environment variables:
```bash
# Database (use Railway, Supabase, or local PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@localhost:5432/looklike_nearby

# Google Maps API (get from Google Cloud Console)
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-maps-api-key

# Authentication (change from default)
APP_PASSWORD=your-secure-password

# Optional: Salesforce integration
SF_USERNAME=your-salesforce-username
SF_PASSWORD=your-salesforce-password
SF_SECURITY_TOKEN=your-salesforce-token
```

### 3. Database Setup

**Option A: Railway (Recommended)**
1. Create account at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Create new PostgreSQL database
3. Copy connection string to `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`

**Option B: Local PostgreSQL**
```bash
# Install PostgreSQL and create database
createdb looklike_nearby

# Update DATABASE_URL in .env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://username:password@localhost:5432/looklike_nearby
```

### 4. Google Maps API Setup

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create new project or select existing
3. Enable APIs:
   - Places API
   - Geocoding API
   - Maps JavaScript API (for future map features)
4. Create API key and add to `.env`
5. Restrict API key to your domains for security

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
# Start development server
python run.py

# Or use uvicorn directly
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 6. Access the Application

- **Web Interface**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health

**Default Login**: Password is `airfare` (configurable via `APP_PASSWORD`)

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

### Project Structure

The application follows FastAPI best practices with clear separation of concerns:

- **Models** (`backend/models/`): Database schema definitions
- **API Routes** (`backend/api/`): HTTP endpoint handlers
- **Services** (`backend/services/`): Business logic layer
- **Core Logic** (`leadgen/`): Reusable business logic (Google Places, matching)

### Adding New Features

1. **Database Changes**: Add/modify models in `backend/models/`
2. **API Endpoints**: Create route handlers in `backend/api/`
3. **Frontend**: Update templates and JavaScript in `frontend/`
4. **Business Logic**: Add reusable functions to `leadgen/`

### Code Quality

All modules follow documentation standards with:
- **WHAT**: Purpose and functionality
- **WHY**: Business logic and reasoning  
- **HOW**: Implementation approach
- **DEPENDENCIES**: External dependencies

## üöÄ Deployment

### Railway (Recommended)

#### Railway CLI Setup

1. **Install Railway CLI**
   ```bash
   # Install globally via npm
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   
   # Or via Homebrew (macOS)
   brew install railway
   ```

2. **Login to Railway**
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. **Initialize Railway Project**
   ```bash
   # Navigate to project root
   cd looklike-nearby
   
   # Link to existing Railway project (if you have one)
   railway link
   
   # Or create new project
   railway init
   ```

4. **Add PostgreSQL Database**
   ```bash
   # Add PostgreSQL database to your project
   railway add postgres
   
   # Link database to your application service
   railway connect
   ```

5. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Set database URL (Railway will provide this)
   railway variables set DATABASE_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://user:password@host:port/database"
   
   # Set Google Maps API key
   railway variables set GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-google-maps-api-key"
   
   # Set application password
   railway variables set APP_PASSWORD="your-secure-password"
   
   # Set debug mode (optional)
   railway variables set DEBUG="false"
   ```

6. **Deploy to Railway**
   ```bash
   # Deploy current branch
   railway up
   
   # Deploy specific branch
   railway up --branch main
   
   # View deployment logs
   railway logs
   
   # Check deployment status
   railway status
   ```

#### Railway Project Management

```bash
# View all projects
railway projects

# Switch between projects
railway project

# View project details
railway project --show

# List all services in project
railway services

# View service logs
railway logs --service backend

# Open Railway dashboard
railway open

# View environment variables
railway variables

# Add new environment variable
railway variables set VARIABLE_NAME="value"

# Remove environment variable
railway variables unset VARIABLE_NAME
```

#### Railway Database Management

```bash
# Connect to PostgreSQL database

   # Check Railway environment variables
   railway variables
   
   # Ensure DATABASE_URL is set correctly
   railway variables get DATABASE_URL
   ```

4. **Test Backend Health**
   ```bash
   # Check if backend is responding
   curl https://your-railway-app.up.railway.app/health
   ```

#### Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Check database connection
railway connect

# View database logs
